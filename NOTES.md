# Notes
This module is going to use libSodium (guide: https://davegebler.com/post/php/php-encryption-the-right-way-with-libsodium). We need to check availability of the required library and output a message if it's not available (similar to FishPig WordPress).

We need to generate the public and private keys on this installation if it doesn't exist yet.
